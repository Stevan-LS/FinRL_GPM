## üöÄ Overview

**FinRL_GPM** is an AI-driven investment portfolio manager leveraging Generalized Policy Mirroring (GPM) reinforcement learning to optimize portfolio allocation across multiple assets. The model learns optimal investment strategies by interacting with financial market environments, aiming to maximize returns while managing risk.

## üß† Technical Approach

This project combines financial market data analysis with deep reinforcement learning. The agent learns to make investment decisions by balancing risk and reward across multiple market conditions. The Generalized Policy Mirroring approach enhances traditional RL by improving policy convergence and stability.
